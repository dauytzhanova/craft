The play, set in Denmark, recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the throne and married Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness—from overwhelming grief to seething rage—and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and moral corruption.\", \n            \"image\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dhOwUuI3L.jpg\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"books_id\": 9,\n            \"title\": \"Moby Dick\",\n            \"author\":\" Herman Melville\",\n            \"type\": \"fiction\",\n            \"genre\": \"drama\",\n            \"publisher\": \"USA Press\",\n            \"format\" : \"hardcover\",\n            \"price\": \"$11\",\n            \"isbn\": \" 9723455559566\",\n            \"description\":\"First published in 1851, Melville's masterpiece is, in Elizabeth Hardwick's words, 'the greatest novel in American literature.' The saga of Captain Ahab and his monomaniacal pursuit of the white whale remains a peerless adventure story but one full of mythic grandeur, poetic majesty, and symbolic power. Filtered through the consciousness of the novel's narrator, Ishmael, Moby-Dick draws us into a universe full of fascinating characters and stories, from the noble cannibal Queequeg to the natural history of whales, while reaching existential depths that excite debate and contemplation to this day.\", \n            \"image\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41h1CVFjjdL.jpg\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"books_id\": 10,\n            \"title\": \"Don Quixote\",\n            \"author\":\"Miguel de Cervantes\",\n            \"type\": \"fiction\",\n            \"genre\": \"drama\",\n            \"publisher\": \"USA Press\",\n            \"format\" : \"hardcover\",\n            \"price\": \"$10\",\n            \"isbn\": \" 9780524563566\",\n            \"description\":\"Alonso Quixano, a retired country gentleman in his fifties, lives in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and a housekeeper.
